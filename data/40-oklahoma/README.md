- **2016** from Oklahoma Data Warehouse
    - precinct polling place locations data as of 2016 (but many counties are mixed years going back to 2012)
        - `The data is up to date and is the same as the individual county data. The file says 2010 because that’s when the Census data was released and precincts were built. They will not change until the 2020 Census data release. Small adjustments are made to precinct boundaries on occasion due to spatial adjustment of road that a boundary may be based on.`
    - There are _less_ precincts in this **2016** file than the **2011** file.
    - Found via email correspondance with Center for Spatial Analysis staff
    - Shapefiles come as state aggregate, or by county
