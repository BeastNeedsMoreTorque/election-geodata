**Source:** Leslie Pelch (Leslie.Pelch@vermont.gov) of VCGI on Jul 18th. VCGI created an accurate precinct layer in consultation with the Vermont Secretary of State's (SoS) office. These precinct geographies supersede legislative house and senate districts as the smallest units at which the SoS reports election results.

This is an ealy access file, the final will be posted at the Vermont open data portal (estimated in August).
