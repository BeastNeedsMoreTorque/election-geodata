Can't find on Data.gov, but if you watch the download pattern you can get it:

- http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2012/VTD/tl_2012_17_vtd10.zip

AutoRedistrict.org does have a copy with some extra attrs:

- ftp://autoredistrict.org/pub/shapefiles_2010_vtd/Illinois/2010/2012/

Asked the state via FOIA for their own version on 2017-03-14.
